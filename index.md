### Short Bio

Hello there! My name is ====== ========= and I am from ======== ============. I lived in ======== for most of my life but moved to ==== in 2021. Some of my hobbies include reading, cooking, watching YouTube videos, and walking. In the future, I would like to travel the world and try food from every country.

I am a second year graduate student studying math at ==== ===== ==========. My advisor is [====== ======](https://www.google.com/). My interests are in algebra, specifically representation theory. I am currently studying the representations of Hopf algebras coming from finite group schemes. Though I mostly think about algebraic problems these days, I also enjoy thinking about combinatorial problems and have even done research in graph theory in the past. 

### Teaching

Currently I am a TA for Math 166 (Calc II). Here are some useful links for my students.
